## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Docs: the [0.1.0] `go install` line below never worked under the `myrgic/` module path (the v0.1.0 tag's go.mod still declared `github.com/cogos-dev/constellation`, pre-rename). Use `go install github.com/myrgic/constellation/cmd/constellation@v0.2.0` or `go build` per the README's Running section instead.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Go module path renamed from `github.com/cogos-dev/constellation` to `github.com/myrgic/constellation` (org rename).
- CI: reusable workflow source updated to `myrgic/.github`.
- All documentation URLs updated to `myrgic/` org.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-14

Proof-of-concept distributed identity and trust protocol for AI agent networks.

### Added

- ECDSA P-256 identity: cryptographic keypairs with NodeID derivation
- EMA trust scoring: decay-based trust with configurable thresholds (0.7 / 0.4 / 0.2)
- 3-layer coherence: hash chain, schema, and temporal monotonicity validation
- Hash-chained ledger: append-only event log with canonical JSON serialization
- HTTP protocol: heartbeat, peer discovery, challenge, join endpoints
- Standalone binary via `go install github.com/myrgic/constellation/cmd/constellation@v0.1.0`
